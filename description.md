## Challenge statement

Welcome to this year’s challenge!
The topic this year is mobility. At a time when the world is facing unprecedented challenges
of various kinds, including climate change, pandemics, social inequality, and declining
biodiversity, shared mobility services offer an emission-free mobility option that is both
efficient and attractive. In this project, we invite you to use your best data science skills to
help operators manage their fleet, providing better service and enhancing their business
model. We do not expect you to discover revolutionary business models with a single Data
Sciences project; instead, we want you to address the mandatory questions (below) but also
seek out new questions, new data, and new insights.
You have access to data from Citi Bike (New York)1, one of the biggest station-based bike-
sharing systems in the United States. The dataset includes more than 900 stations and
14000 bikes, and it contains over 17 million bike rides observed during 2018 (yes, it’s huge).
This dataset has the general objective of helping City Bike operate at its best and of making
bike sharing more attractive. The data itself is an interesting exploration in data science.

## Project

The project has three components:

- Prediction Challenge: All groups must address the same problem.
- Exploratory component: Each group is invited to choose its own research questions and
  explore the data accordingly.
- Report: Each group should deliver one report in a paper format

## The data is provided as a CSV file.

Notice that the variables require extensive treatment to be usable (e.g., Dates, categorical, strings, different scales, IDs).

For the prediction challenge, you are expected to predict the demand for the bike-sharing system (number of dropoffs and pickups). You should do the predictions for clusters of stations. This challenge consists of three tasks:

1. Cluster the stations spatially (nearby departing stations should be grouped together) in no less than 20 clusters. Tasks 2 and 3 will be based on this clustering, and they should be completed for at least two clusters (more is preferable) so that you can compare their respective results and discuss them.

2. You are expected to build a prediction model that, at the end of a day, allows to predict what the demand for a cluster of stations will be over the next 24 hours – i.e. not the total demand for the next day, but how the time-series of the demand will look like for the next day (e.g., given demand data until midnight of day 1, predict the number of pickups for all 1h intervals (12-1am, 1-2am, 6-7am, 7-8am, …, 11-12pm) in day 2). You should predict both the arrivals (i.e., bicycle dropoffs) and the departures (pickups). You should use a time aggregation of one hour or less. You can choose to use two different models or a single one to predict both. It is up to you to determine the most effective way to formulate this problem as a machine learning problem. You should not shuffle the data. You should instead use the data from January to October (included) to train your model, and the data from November and December as a test set. You can use any model you want.

3. Overnight, the bike-sharing company manually repositions its bikes to ensure that demand for the next day can be met. You are expected to use the outputs from the prediction model above to compute the required number of bicycles to be placed in each cluster of stations analyzed in Task 2 at the beginning of the next day. To compute this number, you can use the cumulative of the arrivals and departures. The goal is to ensure that, over the duration of the next day, there will never be a shortage of bikes – or, if there is, the goal is to minimize the number of bikes in deficit. The number of bicycles required can be estimated by extrapolating the maximum difference between the number of departures and arrivals.

In the exploratory component, each group needs to address at least one new research question. Here, we expect you to formulate your own question and follow the data sciences cycle. The project will be positively valued with one or more of the following extensions:

- Extension of the dataset with additional relevant data (such as weather data, national holidays, and special events).
- Generation and analysis of insightful visualizations;
- Usage of the breadth of techniques from the class beyond regression and data preparation (e.g., dimensionality reduction, clustering, classification, time series)

### Some example research questions:
- How to make predictions for each station? What about a cluster of stations?
- Are there periodic and seasonal trends (e.g., winter, summer), and how can we model them?
- What is the impact of land use (e.g., proximity to bus/metro station, shops, residential area vs. business district)?
- What stations are more uncertain in terms of their expected pickups and drop-offs, and how can we ensure that, with a predefined confidence level (e.g., 90% confidence), there will be no imbalances between pickups and drop-offs that result in a shortage of bikes for the next day?

Note: The ordering of tasks we mention is not mandatory. In other words, if you prefer to start with the exploratory component and then go to the prediction challenge, this is also acceptable. You can mention that in the report (or invert Sections 2 and 3). Similarly, data analysis may be presented after the introduction (if relevant). However, please note that a simple descriptive analysis of the data is insufficient to complete the task. Make sure to go one step forward and try at least one of the techniques discussed in the course. Finally, in the exploratory component, you are expected to use at least one of the techniques listed in class (classification, regression, supervised, unsupervised, dimensionality reduction, …).

Ideally, you should also benchmark multiple techniques (e.g., multiple regressors in the case of regression).

### Evaluation
The evaluation of the paper+notebook(s) will be based on the following criteria:
  - Clarity – clarity of the paper and the self-explanatory nature of the notebooks
  - Appendices – We will mainly review the paper and only consult the notebook if needed. If space constraints prevent including certain plots or analyses, they may be added as appendices in the notebook. These must be clearly referenced in the paper and, where appropriate, briefly explained.
  - Thoroughness - Each research question should be examined to a suitable depth. The explanatory component is expected to be developed with a level of detail comparable to the prediction challenge.
  • Insightfulness - Don’t stop at summarizing your findings — explain what kind of business insights or practical implications your results could provide.

Technical aspects:
- Data have been properly analyzed (data cleaning, data preparation, data pre-processing).
- Which model has been used (only one model, multiple models, only linear models, or non-linear models)?
- Is the model and approach appropriate?
- Which performance metrics were used (how performances were evaluated)? Were they appropriate?
- How was the approach benchmarked (how conclusions were drawn)
